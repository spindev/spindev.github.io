Hi, my name is Till and I am from Germany. Currently I am working at [Xpirit](https://xpirit.com) Germany as a DevOps Consultant. I have more than 15 years experience in building and running web applications based on the Microsoft tech stack.

My hobbies next to DevOps & Agile are spending time with my family and my kids. To take a break a drive to a near by lake and go sailing with my own boat. There is nothing better than being on the water and breathe some fresh air and following the wind.

This blog will contain content around DevOps, Developing for Azure and Agile topics.
